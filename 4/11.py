'''
    Random Node: 
    You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch which, in 
    addition to insert, find and elete, has a method called getRandomNode()
    which returns a random Node from the tree. 
    All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen. 
    Design and implement an algorithm for getRandomNode, and explain
    how you would implement the rest of the methods.
