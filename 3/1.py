"""
    Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
"""


"""
    Either you simply the array into three fixed divisons, or have 
    the divisions automatically space and allocate in the array so there's no
    wasted space. Regardless, skipping this problem. 
"""

"""
    P.S.: 
    The problem is incredibly vague. I thought it was asking how to use an 
    existing array as a stack by iterating through it forwards and backwards at first.
