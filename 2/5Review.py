"""
    You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node 
    contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, 
    such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function 
    that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
    EX: (7>1>6) + (5>9>2) = 617+295  Output: 2>1>9 (912)
    Followup:
    Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the problem.
    EX: (6>1>7) + (2>9>5) = 617+295 Output: 9>1>2 (912)
