# Learning Materials Repo
These are the problems I used to learn the data structures and algorithms listed under each folder. This is the bulk of my study material.


The problems are included in the py files at the top, feel free to point out any possible improvements!


**To review concepts I have done some problems multiple times after a long break.**

I have organized the attempts of each problem by folder. The difference in the first solution I made versus the second and third really help show me how far I've come.
