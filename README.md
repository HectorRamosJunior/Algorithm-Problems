# Algorithms and Data Structures
My personal implementations of unique data structures are in the data structures folder, the others are all interesting algorithm solutions to interesting problems done in efficient time and space complexities.


The problem descriptions are included as a dosctrings in the py files at the top, feel free to point out any possible improvements!


**To review concepts I have done some problems multiple times after a long break.**

I have organized the attempts of each problem by folder. The difference in the first solution I made versus the second and third really help show me how far I've come.
