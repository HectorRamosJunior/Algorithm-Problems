    Check Subtree: 
    T1 and T2 are two very large binary trees, with T1 much bigger than T2.
    Create an algorithm to dtermine if T2 is a subtree of T1.
    A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n such that the 
    subtree of n is identical of T2. That is, if you cut off the tree 
    at node n, the two trees would be identical.
